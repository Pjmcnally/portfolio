# portfolio

Welcome to the github repository for my portfolio project.  It is still in development.

This site will function as my portfolio as well as a central hub for all my projects.

This project will always be growing and developing as I add projects.

Currently I am working on the main page itself.  The D&D spellbook app has already been integrated.  Next I plan to integrate my LoL game finder app. An app has also been made for a magic trick I figured out how to turn into a website.
